### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tennille âœ¨


I am an Associate Software Engineer who enjoys the creativity of front end programming.  I am interested in learning more about user interface and user experience (ui/ux) design.

I graduated from Pace University with a Masters in Computer Science, and a minor in Information Systems. I am now currently pursuing a certificate through MIT specializing in FullStack Javascript Programming with MERN.
